This repository contains R scripts for use in 
Carl Stahmer's Digital Methods graduate Proseminar
at UC Davis.  For course syllabus and information
see http://www.carlstahmer.com/digital-methods/

Files include:

scrape_ebba.R
	A file for conducting a search of the English Broadside Ballad Archive,
	scraping the TEI for each item returned, and then saving the body of 
	the text as plain-text.  It demonstrates several R features, including
	getting xml data from the web, using XPath to extract particular
	elements from the returned content, cleaning returned content through
	gsub, and writing of files to the filesystem.  This script relies on
	the XML package developed by Duncan Temple-Lang.  Before you can run
	it you need to install.packages("XML")
